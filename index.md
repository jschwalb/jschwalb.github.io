# Babydoll from Sucker Punch

In the 1960s, a young woman nicknamed Babydoll is institutionalized by her abusive widowed stepfather at a fictional lunatic asylum in Vermont, after he accuses her of her younger sister's death. He bribes asylum orderly Blue Jones to forge the signature of the asylum's psychiatrist, Vera Gorski, to have Babydoll lobotomized so she cannot inform authorities of the true circumstances of her sister's death. During her admission to the institution, Babydoll takes note of four items that she would need to attempt an escape.
